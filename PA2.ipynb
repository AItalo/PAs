    "Write a program (`pa2.py`) that creates plots for the \"pre-processed\" automobile dataset (auto-data.txt) you created for PA1. Pick one method to deal with missing values for this assignment (e.g., eliminate rows with missing values, use means or medians, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will need to perform the following steps and turn in your source code, plots, and a description (i.e., log) of the process you used to \"visualize\" the given data and any insights gained from the visualizations. Your log needs to be written separately from your .py file and may be written in a .txt or a .md (markdown) file. Each chart that you generate must include:\n",
    "* a figure title\n",
    "* labels on the x and y axes where appropriate (see the examples in Figure 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, your final program should save each chart as a PDF file using the `savefig(\"filename.pdf\")` function. Saved charts should start with the step name, e.g., step-1-cylinders.pdf.\n",

    "## Step 1 Frequency Diagrams\n",
    "Create a frequency diagram (sometimes informally referred to as a \"histogram\") for each of the cylinders, model year, and origin attributes of the auto-data.txt dataset. Each diagram should show the frequency (i.e., total number) of cars per value of the given attribute. Use a basic bar chart to draw your frequency diagrams. See Figure 1 for an example for the cylinders attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 Pie Charts\n",
    "Create a pie chart showing the frequency of cars for each of the attributes from step 1. Your pie chart should include the percentages for each attribute value (using `autopct=\"%1.1f%%\"`). See Figure 1 for an example for the cylinders attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3 Dot Charts\n",
    "Create a dot (aka strip) chart showing the values for mpg, displacement, horsepower,\n",
    "weight, acceleration, and msrp. See Figure 1 for an example for mpg. As shown, darker circles indicate more data instances with that value. Some hints for creating a similar looking dot chart: set the y-axis values for each x value to 1; hide the y-axis using `pyplot.gca().get yaxis().set visible(False)`; use the '.' marker and set markersize to a larger default value and set alpha=0.2 to make dots transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4 Discretization\n",
    "There is often a need to transform a continuous attribute into a categorical attribute.\n",
    "Use the following two approaches to convert mpg into a categorical attribute and for each approach create a corresponding frequency diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 1. The US Department of Energy assigns gasoline vehicles a fuel economy rating from 1\n",
    "(worst) to 10 (best). The ratings are defined in terms of mpg as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rating |MPG\n",
    "-|-|\n",
    "10 |≥ 45\n",
    "9 |37–44\n",
    "8 |31–36\n",
    "7 |27–30\n",
    "6 |24–26\n",
    "5 |20–23\n",
    "4 |17–19\n",
    "3 |15–16\n",
    "2 |14\n",
    "1 |≤ 13\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these ranges to define category values (denoting rating 1 to 10) for the mpg attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 2. Create 5 \"equal-width\" bins to generate categories. Each bin should divide up the range of mpg values into equal subranges, where value 1 denotes the smallest subrange of values and 5 the largest subrange of values (see Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each frequency diagram should label bins according to their corresponding ranges (e.g., \"27--30\"). See Figure 1 for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5 Histograms\n",
    "Create a histogram using the `pyplot.hist()` function for each of the attributes in Step 3. Use the default of 10 bins (see Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6 Relationships A\n",
    "Create scatter plots that compare displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration,\n",
    "and msrp to mpg (i.e., where mpg is the y-axis in each scatter plot). Be sure to appropriately label the x and y axes. Figure 1 gives an example for displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7 Relationships B\n",
    "Write a function to calculate (least-squares) linear regressions and create scatter\n",
    "plots with the corresponding linear regression lines for comparing displacement, horsepower, weight, and msrp to mpg. Create one additional scatter plot with a linear regression line comparing displacement to weight. Label each plot with the correlation coefficient and covariance. Figure 1 gives an example for displacement compared to mpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8 Relationships C\n",
    "Create a chart to compare categorical/continuous attributes. To do this, create a box plot describing MPG (continuous) by model year (where we view year as categorical). An example of the chart is shown in Figure 1."
