    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For this programming assignment, we are going to use a **Jupyter Notebook** to tell a story about exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a real-world clinical dataset. The dataset needs cleaning and contains interesting insights once aggregated and visualized. Your source code, log, and charts will be combined in your Jupyter Notebook with well-organized, interleaved code cells and markdown cells. Here are general requirements that your Notebook should conform to:\n",
    "* Your EDA story should be logically divided into different section levels, appropriately labeled using markdown headers, and contain well-written commentary describing the code, results, and insights you come up with\n",
    "* Each chart that you generate must be generated inline in the Notebook and include a figure title and labels on the x and y axes where appropriate\n",
    "* Each formula that you use in your code must be typeset using Latex and described in markdown\n",
    "    * E.g. formulas used for stats and linear regression/predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: as you write solutions for the following steps, I highly encourage you to design functions that are generic and re-usable for future programming assignments and data mining tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we are learning data mining from scratch! The only non-standard libraries you should need to use for this assignment include matplotlib, numpy (sparingly), csv (if you'd like to use it for file I/O), and tabulate (if you'd like to use it for pretty printing). This means no pandas...\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "Download the patient_data_to_clean.csv dataset from https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC310/PAs/tree/master/files.

    "    * The FIM is a clinical assessment used to measure patient functioning at inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. The FIM is measured at two distinct points in time: admission and discharge. \n",
    "    * The FIM measures the level of assistance required to perform 18 ADL tasks. \n",
    "    * The tasks are categorized as either motor (13 tasks) or cognitive (5 tasks). Each task is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale to measure independence as determined by the amount of assistance required to perform each ADL task. \n",
    "    * For more information about the FIM, see Section III in the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services IRF-PAI training manual](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/inpatientrehabfacpps/downloads/irfpai-manual-2012.pdf).\n",

Upon further exploration, we see this column truly was free response for the clinicians to enter text. For example, take a look at IDs 179, 611, 1610, and 4287! We are going to do some string matching to apply a uniform encoding for the Marital Status column.
